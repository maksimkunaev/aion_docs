Your perspective aligns with several important areas in cognitive science and AI. Based on your description, here are some relevant books that explore these concepts:

1. "Cognitive Maps and Spatial Reasoning":
   - "The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map" by John O'Keefe and Lynn Nadel
     This classic work explores how the brain creates and uses spatial representations.

2. "Conceptual Spaces: The Geometry of Thought" by Peter GÃ¤rdenfors
   Discusses how concepts can be represented as geometric structures in cognitive spaces.

3. "Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference, and Consciousness" by Philip N. Johnson-Laird
   Explores how people use mental models for reasoning and understanding.

4. "The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory" by Donald O. Hebb
   While older, this book introduces ideas about neural networks and associative learning that are still relevant.

5. "How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed" by Ray Kurzweil
   Discusses pattern recognition in the brain and how it relates to intelligence.

6. "Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire of Thinking" by Douglas Hofstadter and Emmanuel Sander
   Explores how analogy and concept formation are central to cognition.

7. "The Predictive Mind" by Jakob Hohwy
   Discusses predictive processing in perception and cognition.

8. "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman
   While not strictly about AI, it provides insights into human reasoning processes.

9. "The Language of Thought" by Jerry Fodor
   Explores the idea of mental representation and how it relates to language and thought.

10. "Perceptual Symbol Systems" by Lawrence W. Barsalou (paper)
    Discusses how perceptual and motor systems contribute to conceptual knowledge.

11. "Steps Toward Artificial Intelligence" by Marvin Minsky (paper)
    An older but foundational paper that discusses search, planning, and learning in AI.

These resources cover various aspects of your vision, including perception, concept formation, internal representations, and reasoning processes. They provide a mix of cognitive science and AI perspectives that could help refine and expand your ideas.
