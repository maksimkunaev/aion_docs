# Pattern-Based World Model Representation

## Core Concept
Create a simplified world model representation using patterns of numerical data, rather than complex semantic/language understanding.

## Architecture

### 1. Input Layer
- Object Types: [person, plant, tool, etc.]
- Object IDs: ["Alice", "box1", etc.]
- Attribute Types: [size, health, affection, etc.]

### 2. Output Layer
Simple numerical patterns (1D/2D arrays) showing changes/relationships:
```python
# Basic Patterns
Increase: [0.1, 0.5, 0.9]
Decrease: [0.9, 0.5, 0.1]
Movement: [coord1, coord2, coord3]
Tension->Release: [0.9, 0.4, 0.1]
```

## Key Benefits
1. Reduces complex scenarios to simple patterns
2. Using same pattern types across different contexts
3. Metadata provides meaning, pattern provides structure
4. Easy integration with neural networks
5. Lightweight alternative to full semantic reasoning

## Example Applications
```python
# Emotional/Social Scenarios
"Girl ignored -> gets attention -> happy"
Input: {type: person, attribute: attention}
Pattern: [0.1, 0.1, 0.8]

# Physical Changes
"Plant grows"
Input: {type: plant, attribute: size}
Pattern: [0.2, 0.5, 0.8]

# Relationships
"Alice likes Bob"
Input: {types: [person, person], attribute: affection}
Pattern: [0.2, 0.8]
```

## Integration with LLMs
1. LLM identifies scenario type
2. Maps to appropriate pattern
3. Outputs numerical representation

This system bridges language models and structured world modeling by representing common sense knowledge through simple numerical patterns, making it easier to process and reason about complex scenarios using basic mathematical relationships.

The power comes from maintaining simplicity while capturing essential relationships and changes in an easily processable format. Instead of complex reasoning, we create a library of basic patterns that can represent most common-sense scenarios through simple numerical changes.
