**🔍 Your initial goal:**
To test whether an LLM can build an *internal* world model (e.g., a 2D map with objects) **end-to-end**, purely from text — without manual parsing. And if not directly, then through intermediate representations that can be parsed.

---

## 🧩 What we discussed:

### 1. **Approaches to world-model construction**

* **Low-level (physical):** tracking all coordinates as in a physics simulation.
* **High-level (linguistic):** storing only semantic facts like “Alice is near the rabbit hole.”
* **Intermediate (hybrid):** the LLM builds a simplified *symbolic* world model (e.g., a 2D grid with objects) using coordinates and relations.

---

### 2. **Your experimental idea**

* Create a **simple dataset**: text → 2D map (or object coordinates).
* Train or test an LLM **end-to-end**:

  * Input: `"The square is to the left of the circle"`
  * Output: `{"square": [1,2], "circle": [2,2]}` or a 10×10 grid.

---

### 3. **Problems and risks**

* **LLMs struggle to output coordinates** (numbers) directly — intermediate layers help.
* **You tried a dense model**, but it failed to learn basic spatial relations (up, down, left, right).
* **Scalability:** manually encoding every object and action won’t scale.
* **Hope in emergence:** maybe a good format will let the LLM learn naturally.

---

### 4. **Solution — introduce a parser**

To help the LLM or extract structure:

* A **parser** can extract relationships → then build a map.
* Options:

  * Rule-based
  * Graph-based
  * ML-based
  * Or: LLM → intermediate description → coordinates

---

## ✅ Next steps:

1. **Create a small dataset** — 5–10 simple sentences + manually defined coordinates.
2. **Try a basic pipeline:**

   * Input: text → LLM → intermediate relations
   * Parser → coordinates or grid map
3. **Evaluate:** how accurately the model reconstructs the scene.
