## What You've Attempted So Far

Looking at your experiments:

1. **LLM → World Model attempts**: You tried training LLMs to build spatial models from text, which failed due to:
   - LLMs being poor with numerical coordinates
   - Lack of quality training data
   - Models finding "cheat" solutions instead of true understanding

2. **Common Sense Engine**: A more modular approach with:
   - Text Parser → World Model → Action Patterns → Cause-Effect reasoning
   - State-based world representation
   - Relative spatial relationships instead of absolute coordinates

3. **Hallucination Detection**: You've identified systematic failure modes in current LLMs around factual consistency

## Critical Issues with Current Approach

**Cons:**
- You're conflating two problems: building accurate world models AND reasoning over them
- The "complete world model" requirement is overengineered for proving your core idea
- You're trying to solve data generation, model training, and reasoning architecture simultaneously
- No clear success criteria - what would prove this works?

**Pros:**
- Core insight is sound: structured representations enable better reasoning
- Modular architecture allows iterative development
- Focus on relative relationships vs absolute coordinates is smart
- State-based temporal modeling is a proven approach

## Reformulated Approach

Based on your latest instruction, here's the new framing:

## Reasoning System Requirements

**Data Structure Foundation:**
- Concepts (entities)
- Properties (attributes)
- Relationships (connections)
- Actions (state transitions)
- Temporal snapshots (world states over time)

**Capability Tiers** (from simple to complex):

### Tier 1: Retrieval
*Extract explicitly stated information*

Questions:
- What type is concept X?
- What property does object A have?
- What relationship exists between A and B?
- Where is X located?
- What color is Y?

### Tier 2: Simple Reasoning
*Compare, compute, aggregate information*

Questions:
- How many objects are in location X?
- Which object is larger/smaller?
- What's the sum/average of property P?
- Are A and B the same type?
- What do X and Y have in common?

### Tier 3: Causal Reasoning
*Infer cause-effect relationships*

Questions:
- Why did event X happen?
- What caused state change Y?
- Who/what is responsible for outcome Z?
- What would happen if action A occurs?
- What are the prerequisites for event X?

### Tier 4: Goal-Oriented Planning
*Analyze systems and achieve objectives*

Questions:
- How can Alice obtain the book?
- What sequence of actions makes Alice the most powerful queen?
- What's the optimal path to achieve goal G?
- What resources are needed to accomplish X?
- What are alternative strategies to reach outcome Y?

**Open Questions:**
- How to represent the data internally?
- How to construct world models?
- What algorithms for problem-solving?
- How to handle incomplete information?

**Constraints:**
- Must work with the defined data structure
- Must solve tasks across all capability tiers
- Implementation details are TBD

**This approach separates WHAT the system must do from HOW it will do it, allowing you to evaluate different implementation strategies against clear success criteria.**
